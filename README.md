# Car price prediction
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the prices of used cars using various machine learning models. The goal is to build an accurate model that can estimate the price of a car based on its features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

# Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the prices of used cars using historical data. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We explore various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model for this task.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as:

-Make: The brand of the car (e.g., Ford, Toyota).
-Model: The specific model of the car.
-Year: The manufacturing year of the car.
-Mileage: The distance the car has been driven.
-Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
-Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
-Engine Size: The size of the car's engine.
-Price: The target variable, representing the price of the car.

# Data Preprocessing
Before training the models, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps, including:

-Handling missing values.
-Encoding categorical variables.
-Scaling numerical features.
-Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
These steps are implemented in the data_preprocessing.py script.

# Modeling
Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including:

-Linear Regression
-Decision Tree Regressor
-Random Forest Regressor
-Gradient Boosting Regressor
The model training process is detailed in the model_training.py script, and the results are compared to identify the best-performing model.

# Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as:

-Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
-Mean Squared Error (MSE)
-R-squared (R2) Score
These metrics help in understanding the model's accuracy and performance.

# Results
The final model selected for predicting car prices is the Random Forest Regressor. This model provided the best balance between accuracy and generalization, with a low error rate and high R2 score.
